# Ray Tracing in One Day

Working through Ray Tracing in One Day. This is a great introduction into graphics programming.

It can be found at:
https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

I've split out each section into its own branch so you can see the progression of the lessons.
In addition to that, I've added extra comments and questions of my own in order to understand
it better.
